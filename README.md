# Survivor Script In Perl

# Take a second to imagine that you are in a room with 100 chairs arranged in a circle.
# These chairs are numbered sequentially from one to one onehundred.
# At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be told to leave the room.
# The person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be told to leave.
# Next to go is person in chair #6. In other words, 1 person will be skipped initially, 
# and then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, .. and so on.
# This pattern of skipping will keep going around the circle until there is only one person remaining.. the survivor.
# Note that the chair is removed when the person leaves the room.
# If Kanye West were to choose a chair, such that he never got asked to leave, which chair would he choose?
